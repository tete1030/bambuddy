"""MakerWorld integration routes.

User pastes a model URL (MakerWorld or other supported host) → Bambuddy resolves
it → shows plate list → one-click import/print. The URL-paste flow covers the
actual discovery pattern (Reddit/YouTube/shared links) without needing to
replicate the host's whole search UI.

Search/browse endpoints are intentionally NOT exposed: the public-facing
``design/search`` endpoint returns empty results from server-originated
requests (see memory/makerworld-integration.md for the investigation).

These are still the *MakerWorld* routes: they consult the shared seams where
one exists — URL routing via :class:`ModelProviderRegistry`, permissions and
folder naming from the provider descriptor, already-imported matching via
:meth:`ModelProvider.source_url_filter` — but request/response shapes remain
MakerWorld-specific. The fully shared import API that makes new hosts work
with zero route changes arrives with #2793.
