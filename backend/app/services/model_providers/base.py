"""Model-provider interface.

A *model provider* is a website that hosts 3D printer models (MakerWorld,
Thingiverse, Printables, ...) whose files Bambuddy can resolve and import
into the library. This module defines the contract every provider must
fulfil — the split being:

  * :class:`ModelProvider` — the static, provider-wide descriptor: identity
    (``source_type``, ``display_name``), URL routing (``host_patterns``),
    the auth it needs (or explicitly doesn't), and a factory that builds a
    per-request :class:`ProviderService` seeded with the caller's stored
    credentials.
  * :class:`ProviderService` — one HTTP client per request, mirroring the
    ``BambuCloudService`` construction pattern: resolve a model URL to
    metadata + importable files, resolve + fetch a concrete download, and
    proxy thumbnail images. Providers are *thin transports*: shared concerns
    (library dedupe, folder auto-creation, ``save_3mf_bytes_to_library``)
    stay in the route layer so every provider benefits from them.

The interface deliberately covers everything the MakerWorld integration
needs today (see ``model_providers/makerworld/``) so that adding a new site
is: implement ``ModelProvider`` + ``ProviderService``, register it, and the
shared import API routes pasted URLs to it via ``registry.find_for_url``.

Only interoperability — not affiliated with or endorsed by MakerWorld or any
other provider, and not intended to circumvent any access control.
