"""MakerWorld HTTP layer.

Constants and the low-level transport helpers for the MakerWorld / Bambu Lab
APIs: the S3 presigned-download path that must reach the transport
byte-for-byte, upstream error extraction, and the CDN SSRF guard helpers used
by :class:`MakerWorldService`.

The app-scoped shared ``httpx`` client lives with its consumer instead (see
``service.set_shared_http_client``) — same-module so the service reads the
live value, matching ``bambu_cloud`` / ``orca_cloud`` / ``slicer_api``.

    ``urllib.request`` verifies against the *OS* trust store, while httpx —
    every other network call in Bambuddy — verifies against the bundled
    ``certifi`` CA bundle. On Windows those two disagree: Python's
    ``ssl.load_default_certs()`` only enumerates the roots already cached in
    the Windows ROOT store, and Windows populates that store lazily via
    CryptoAPI's auto-update, which Python never triggers. If the Amazon root
    signing the S3 chain isn't cached on that machine yet, verification fails
    with ``unable to get local issuer certificate`` — even though the
    api.bambulab.com calls that preceded it (httpx) succeeded.

    Pinning urllib to certifi makes the S3 hop trust exactly what the rest of
    the app already trusts. Built per call rather than at import so a certifi
    refresh doesn't require a restart; construction is cheap relative to the
